# WiFi-Locator
## Aim
The project aims to detect a hypothetical grid's WiFi signal power and find points with highest signal strengths. 
## Summary
Wi-Fi access have become more prevalent at any modern venue. The signal strength is an important factor of Wi-Fi connectivity. The task involves impelementing a program that models the Wi-Fi signal strength at a specific region. More details are provided in the project specification 'COMP20005_a2.pdf'.
